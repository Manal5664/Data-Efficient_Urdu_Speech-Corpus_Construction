## References and Research Basis

This work is grounded in prior research on low-resource speech processing, data-efficient corpus construction, 
and distribution-aware subset selection techniques. Existing studies have explored the use of greedy and core-set based algorithms, 
active learning strategies, and data selection methods to reduce annotation cost while preserving linguistic and statistical diversity. 
Research on text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition systems for low-resource languages highlights the importance of representative text selection, lexical coverage, and distributional similarity for building high-quality speech corpora. Additionally, prior work on Urdu speech corpus development provides foundational insights into language-specific challenges and resource constraints. The methods and evaluation 
metrics adopted in this project are motivated by these established research directions and are adapted to the context of data-efficient Urdu 
speech corpus construction.
